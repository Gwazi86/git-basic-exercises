Processor chips generate quite a bit of heat, which could cause the chip to burn up.
Although the computer’s main fan generates airflow, many of today’s personal computer processors require additional cooling.
Heat sinks/pipes and liquid cooling technologies often are used to help dissipate processor heat.


A heat sink is a small ceramic or metal component with fins on its surface that absorbs and disperses heat produced by
electrical components such as a processor.
